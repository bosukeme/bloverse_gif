After cloning, 

*Install docker (use the convenient script section of the official docker website) <br>
*Install docker-compose too. 

1. Run <b>"docker-compose build"</b> or <b>"sudo docker-compose build"</b> <br>
##Might take a long time with much data consumption

2. Once that runs well, then do <b>"docker-compose up"</b> or <b>"sudo docker-compose up"</b>
